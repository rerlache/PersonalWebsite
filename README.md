# PersonalWebsite
Project for my personal Website

## BlazorServerApp
this is my personal site based on blazor, which will be used as final website<br>
added nuget package ([BlazorTimeline](https://github.com/Morasiu/BlazorTimeline)) to the project.

## robinerlacher.online
was my first try with asp.net .. used razor for that, but will switch over to blazor, so it won't be maintained any longer.<br>
the content will stay here, for me to lookup some stuff.
